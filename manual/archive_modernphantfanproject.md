# Composer Notes

## Optimism Ambition Naivety

Each words meaning:

- **Optimism**: A positive outlook or belief that things will turn out well. It can encourage risk-taking and action, even in uncertain situations.
- **Ambition**: A strong desire to achieve something or reach a goal. It implies determination and drive.
- **Naivety**: Innocence or lack of experience, often associated with seeing the world through rose-colored glasses.

Together, these words create an interesting juxtaposition. Here are a few interpretations:

- **Positive View**: The combination suggests someone who approaches life with optimism and ambition, perhaps even naivety. They believe in possibilities and strive for success.
- **Irony**: Alternatively, it could be used ironically. For instance, if someone's optimism and ambition lead them to make naive decisions, this phrase could highlight that contrast.

## Lunar Love Lullaby

“Lunar Love Lullaby” combines several evocative elements:

- Lunar: Refers to the moon, often associated with mystery, romance, and dreams. The moon’s phases symbolize change and cycles.

- Love: Represents affection, passion, and emotional connection.

- Lullaby: A soothing, gentle song, often sung to calm or comfort someone, especially children.

So, “Lunar Love Lullaby” could be interpreted as a tender, moonlit melody that expresses love and tranquility.

Well refer to the album cover of Aran - Aphotic Seeker, you will get it
